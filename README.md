## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a bare-bones micro web framework written in Python and based on Werkzeug, Jinja2, and good intentions.

Using the three in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app with a powerful backend.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.

### Inspiration

Directly inspired by [a previous React Repl](https://replit.com/@replit/Reactjs), and [a previous Flask authentication Repl(@mat1)](https://replit.com/talk/learn/Authenticating-users-with-Replit-Auth/23460). This takes code liberally from both.
